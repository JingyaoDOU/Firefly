Firefly: a browser-based interactive particle data visualization platform
================================================================

Firefly is an interactive application for visualizing particle-based data 
from within the web browser. In addition to the various source files 
that power the webapp there is a Python frontend to enable users to 
load their own datasets into Firefly. 

Firefly can be run from entirely within a Jupyter notebook using the
Python frontend.
